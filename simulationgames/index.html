            <h2><em>Setup</em></h2>
            <p>To set up a game, DM the command sg!setup to the bot.<br>
               Note that this will fail if someone else is setting up a game, or if a game is currently in progress.<br>
               The bot will then guide you through setup; take notice of the comment at the bottom of the tribute list.</p>
            <h2><em>Starting the Game</em></h2>
            <p>To start the game, send the command sg!start to the channel you want the game to take place in.<br> 
                Only the person who set up the game can do this.</p>
            <h2><em>Progressing the Game</em></h2>
            <p>To progress the game, send the command sg!next to the channel the game is taking place in.<br>
                This can only be done by the person who set up the game, and can only be done in the channel the game was started in.</p>
            <h2><em>Stopping Mid-Game</em></h2>
            <p>To stop a game which is in progress, send the command sg!stop to the channel it is taking place in.<br>
